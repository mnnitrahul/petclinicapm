A comprehensive RESTful API for managing pet clinic appointments built with Azure Functions and Cosmos DB.

## 🚀 Quick Start

This project provides three core appointment management functions:
- **Create Appointments** - Add new appointments with full validation
- **Get All Appointments** - Retrieve appointments with pagination and filtering  
- **Get Single Appointment** - Fetch specific appointments by ID

## 📚 **Complete Documentation**

👉 **For detailed API documentation, setup instructions, and development guide, see:**

### **[APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md)**

This comprehensive guide includes:
- Complete API endpoint specifications
- Request/response examples  
- Database setup and configuration
- Local development setup
- Deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations

## ⚡ Quick Setup for Development

1. **Install dependencies and setup environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 setup_local_dev.py
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables** (see [API Guide](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md#environment-variables))

4. **Start local development:**
   ```bash
   func start
   ```

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 test_functions.py
```

Should return: `🎉 All tests passed! Your Azure Functions are ready for deployment.`

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Future Developers/Agents

**⚠️ CRITICAL: When making changes to this system:**

1. **Always update the [APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md)** when making design changes
2. **The API Guide is the single source of truth** for this system
3. **Run tests after changes:** `python3 test_functions.py` 
4. **Update examples in documentation** if API contracts change
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** or document breaking changes

### Knowledge Base Maintenance

This repository uses `APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md` as its comprehensive knowledge base. Any agent working on this project should:

- **Reference the API Guide first** for understanding the system
- **Update the API Guide immediately** after making any changes
- **Keep examples current** with actual implementation
- **Document all environment variables** and configuration changes
- **Update troubleshooting section** with new known issues

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Review the [API Guide](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md) to understand the system
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests: `python3 test_functions.py`
4. **Update documentation** in `APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md`
5. Test your changes locally with `func start`

## 📞 Support

- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting) first
- Review [Common Issues](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md#common-issues) 
- For VS Code autocomplete issues, see [Local Development Setup](APPOINTMENT_API_GUIDE.md#local-development)
